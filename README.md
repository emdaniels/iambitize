Iambitize
==========

Iambitize is a program that creates iambic pentameters out of any text corpus. 
It requires Python 2.7, pronouncing, and some other standard Python modules to 
run properly.

An iambic pentameter is a type of metrical line often found in traditional 
English poetry. The term describes the rhythm the words establish in a line, 
which is measured in feet, or small groups of syllables. An iambic foot is an
 unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. A standard line of iambic 
pentameter is five iambic feet in a row:

`da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM`

An example from Shakespeare:

"When I do count the clock that tells the time"

To run, download the files along with any text corpus, and enter the 
following in the command prompt:

    $ python iambitize.py [text corpus].txt


Iambic pentameters in Ulysses:
>a stick and an umbrella dangled to

>the daughter of the skies the virgin moon 

>addicted runs directly counter to 

>themselves in stylish garters leaping from
